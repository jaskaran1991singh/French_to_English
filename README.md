# French_to_English
The French_to_English bot is an intelligent image translation assistant designed to extract and translate French text from images into accurate English. Using advanced Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), the bot performs the following steps:

1. Image Analysis – Scans and detects all French text content from images (e.g., signs, menus, documents, posters).

2. Text Extraction – Accurately reads printed or handwritten French text using OCR technology.

3. Translation – Translates the extracted French content into fluent and context-aware English.

4. Output – Presents the translated English text in a clean, readable format alongside the original French, if desired.
